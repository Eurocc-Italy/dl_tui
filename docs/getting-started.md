# Getting Started

## Installation

We highly recommend installing the software in a custom Python virtual environment. You can set up a virtual environment with third-party tools such as [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/index.html) or with the built-in [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) module.

After having set up and activated your virtual environment, install the DTaaS TUI with the following commands:

  ```bash
  git clone https://gitlab.hpc.cineca.it/lbabetto/dtaas-tui  
  pip install dtaas-tui/
  ```
